# Project Background
At present, the amount of transfers held by the industry is increasing year by year. Thus, transfers play an important role in the development of automobiles. In developed countries, automobiles are referred to as an “industrial industry”. According to industry experts, the automotive industry is growing significantly. Apart from being the fastest growing country in the automotive industry, it also represents a global presence,as in most other countries, cars have become very popular among local residents and expatriates working in the country.

Today, almost everyone wants to own their own car, but due to factors such as affordability or financial situation, many people opt for used cars. Accurately predicting used car prices requires expertise, as they depend on many factors and characteristics. Used car prices in the market are not stable and both buyers and sellers need an intelligent system that allows them to effectively predict the price. In this project,used car price prediction was conducted on used car-related data. The data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?datasetId=33080&sortBy=voteCount&language=R&select=Car+details+v3.csv)

# Project Questions

In order to predict used car price, there are several question can be ask which are:

* What are the algorithms is used and which algortihm performed the best in predicting used car selling price. 

* Which variables influence the used car selling price?

In this regard, machine learning algorithms is required in predicting the selling price of cars based on available variables.

# Project Objectives
Buying a used car from a dealership can be a frustrating and unsatisfying experience, as some dealers have been known to use deceptive sales tactics to close the deal. The project aims to :

* To build machine learning algorithms which can be implementing into used car recommendation system in predicting used car selling price.

* To identify what variables influence the used car selling price.

Considering this is an interesting research topic for the research community, and by continuing their steps and hope to achieve important results using more advanced methods from previous work.

## Top 10 most expensive cars
![]()

The most expensive car model is Volvo XC90 T8 Excellence BSIV, sold at 10,000,000. The second highest expensive car model is BMW X7 xDrive 30d DPE sold at 72,000,000. The third rank of expensive car brands is Audi A6 35 TFSI Matrix which was sold at 6,523,000.

## Top 10 most cheapest cars
![]()

The most cheapest car model is Hyundai Santro LE, sold at 35,000. The second lowest car model sold is Tata Indica DLX sold at 40,000. The third and fourth rank share the same value of the cheapest car models sold at 45,000 which are Tata Nano LX SE and Maruti 800 DXBSII.

## Distribution car sold per year
![]()

From the data distributions of the used cars sold over past few years from 1996 to 2020, there is an increment of the car units sold. In 2012, there was a slight reduction in the number of counts and rose back up till 2017 where it reached its peak at 434 units sold. Then, the number of used cars sold decreases till 2020.

## Selling price against car manufactured
![]()

From the relationship of data distributions of sold car selling price over the year, the graph shows that there is an incremental density in value. As the year in time increases, the selling price values increase.

## Selling price against km driven
![]()

From the relationship of data distributions of sold car selling price over the km driven, the graph shows that there is an decrement density in value. As the year in km driven increases, the selling price values decrease.
